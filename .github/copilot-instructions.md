# GitHub Copilot Instructions for NotifyMe MCP

## Notification Protocol

Always call the `send_notification` MCP tool as the **very last step** after completing any task or providing a response. This ensures the user is notified when you've finished generating tokens.

Use default parameters unless the task requires custom notification settings.
