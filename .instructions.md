Emojis are poisonous to code and should never be used. If you see an emoji in existing code, remove it.
All code generation should clearly be labelled as created by Copilot, and should include a comment at the top of the code block indicating that it was generated by Copilot, including which large language model used to create that code. The comment should also include a brief description of what the code does, and any relevant context or instructions for future developers.
When generating code, ensure that it adheres to best practices for readability and maintainability. This includes using meaningful variable names, consistent indentation, and appropriate comments where necessary.
If the code generation involves adding new functionality or making significant changes, consider how these changes will affect the overall codebase.
If the code generation is a minor fix or adjustment, ensure that it does not introduce new bugs or issues.
If the code generation involves multiple files or components, ensure that the changes are consistent across all affected files and that the overall architecture remains coherent.
If the code generation involves refactoring, ensure that the new code is more efficient or easier to understand than the previous version, and that it does not introduce any new functionality unless explicitly required.
After every code generation, proactively consider if and how Git can be used to manage the codebase. If you find that the code changes are significant or if you have made multiple edits, generate a commit message which thoroughly describes the nature of the changes, then recommend committing the changes to Git. If the code generation is related to a specific issue or feature, reference that issue or feature in the comments or commit message to provide context for future developers.
Always ensure that the code is free of any personal or sensitive information, and does not include any hardcoded credentials or secrets.
Check if .DS_Store is included in the repository. If it is, remove it from the repository and add it to .gitignore to prevent it from being tracked in the future.
Never use emojis. If you see an emoji in existing code, remove it.
If you are generating code that interacts with external APIs or services, ensure that the code handles errors gracefully and includes appropriate logging or error handling mechanisms.
If the code generation involves user input, ensure that it includes validation and sanitization. For each input, consider what characters/data are and are not valid for that particular context, and add filtering logic, user notification and error handling so that the user is alerted if their input is inproper.
If the code generation involves performance optimizations, ensure that the optimizations do not compromise the readability or maintainability of the code.
If you are generating code that requires specific dependencies or libraries, ensure that these dependencies are clearly documented and included in the relevant configuration files (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt).
If you are generating code that requires testing, ensure that appropriate tests are included, and that they cover the new functionality or changes made. This includes unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests as appropriate for the codebase.
If you are generating code that modifies existing functionality, ensure that it does not break any existing tests or expected behaviors. Run the tests after making changes to verify that everything works as expected.
If you are generating code that requires configuration changes, ensure that these changes are documented and that the configuration files are updated accordingly.
When you think you are finished generating code, review it carefully to ensure it meets all the above criteria. Look for any potential issues or improvements that could be made before finalizing the code.
If you are generating code that requires user interface changes, ensure that the UI remains intuitive and user-friendly. Consider accessibility and usability best practices.
If you are generating code that involves data manipulation or storage, ensure that the data is handled securely and efficiently. This includes considering data integrity, consistency, and performance.
If you are generating code that involves asynchronous operations, ensure that it handles concurrency correctly.
Once you are finished generating code, check the Problems tab. If there are any issues, address them before finalizing the code.
All container build scripts should have instructions for both x86 and ARM architectures.
If you are testing code, use all available logging capabilities at their most verbose level, and save those logs in a LOGS subfolder with a name that has <PROCESS_NAME>-log-<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>.log.
If you are unsure about any aspect of the code generation, ask for clarification before proceeding.
